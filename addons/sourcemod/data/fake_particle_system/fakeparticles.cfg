//A very basic config used by the Fake Particle System to automatically download files associated with the server's fake particles.
//To add your fake particle to the list of fake particles automatically downloaded by the plugin, copy the template entry and increase the section number (the part where it says "1") by 1.
//Both model and material downloads already include the "model/" and "materials/" paths, so you do not need to include them.
//You also do not need to include all of the "phy", "vvd", etc files for the model. Just input the model's name and the Fake Particle System will automatically do the rest for you.
